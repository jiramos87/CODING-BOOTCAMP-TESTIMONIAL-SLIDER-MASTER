## My process

After reading the README and the styleguide, I looked on googlefonts for the desired fonts. After deciding upon wich technology repertoire to use, I layed down the HTML skeleton.  The next step was defining the class names of the divs and then adjusting their CSS properties.  For the programming logic I had to look up on google for a vanilla JS carousel and study its parts before inserting them in my code.    

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript


### What I learned

It took me approx 3 hours to complete this project.  This timing is helful because it can make me estimate better my delivery time.

### Continued development

The project is currently lacking the responsiveness. I should work on that soon enough.
